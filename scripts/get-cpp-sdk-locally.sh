# This is meant to be run when testing out changes locally. In contrast, the remote CI
# fetches prebuilt artifacts from github based on a release tag.
#
# Locally, it's more convenient to built the C++ SDK from source - to be able to switch branches,
# change built options, etc.

# Usage: ./scripts/build-cpp-server.sh <tag>
# If no tag is supplied, it uses 'main'.
#
# The SDK headers/libs are installed in ./cpp-sdks/build/INSTALL.
